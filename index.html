Enoch Yi's Github IO page

I like to code earlier in the day for long periods of time, in a focused environment. I always drink caffeine before a session as it helps me stay focused, and keeps my problem solving skills in top shape. I make sure to always indent properly, and make sure the code i write is not messy. Most of all, I love the satisfaction I feel after completing a difficult assignment.
